This hotel is perfect, IMO. Easy check in and check out. Lovely, clean, comfortable rooms with great views of the city. I know this area pretty well and it's very convenient to many downtown Chicago attractions. We had dinner and went clubing with our friends around Division St.. We had no problems getting cabs back and forth to the Hyatt and there's even public transportation right near by but we didn't bother since we only needed cabs from and to the hotel. Parking, as is usual for Chicago, was expensive but we were able to get our car out quickly (however, we left on a Sunday morning, not exactly a high traffic time although it was a Bears homegame day, so a bit busier than usual I would think). No problems at all and the best part is that we got a rate of $100 through Hotwire, a downright steal for this area of Chicago and the quality of the hotel. \\n</td>\n",

I was delayed from a very important client due to a latency issue with my reserved room, and if that was not enough.

I felt like he was trying to pressure me into staying more days than I wanted to. Not only that, but I couldn't understand what he was saying most of the time because he was talking so fast. When I finally got to my room, I was disappointed with the quality of the furniture and the room's cleanliness. I had to ask for a maid to come and give me clean towels because some of the towels in the bathroom were damp. On top of that, the bed was messily done; I could have done a better job on my own bed at home. I was angry at this point, because I was paying a lot of money for every night I was staying at Amalfi, and I didn't expect to be greeted with wet towels. I needed to use the Wi-Fi to download some important documents, and the internet was surprisingly slow. Even a very basic hotel or motel could have offered better, maybe even faster internet access. When I finally checked out of the Amalfi, I made sure that my supposed personal concierge knew all of the problems I'd had with my room and the hotel. I was glad to see the Amalfi getting smaller in the mirror as I drove away!\\n</td>\n",

Triple AAA rate of 173 was a steal. 7th floor room complete with 44in plasma TV bose stereo, voss and evian water, and gorgeous bathroom(no tub but was fine for us) Concierge was very helpful. You cannot beat this location... Only flaw was breakfast was pricey and service was very very slow(2hours for four kids and four adults on a friday morning) even though there were only two other tables in the restaurant. Food was very good so it was worth the wait. I would return in a heartbeat. A gem in chicago... \\n  \n",

This hotel is perfect, IMO. Easy check in and check out. Lovely, clean, comfortable rooms with great views of the city. I know this area pretty well and it's very convenient to many downtown Chicago attractions. We had dinner and went clubing with our friends around Division St.. We had no problems getting cabs back and forth to the Hyatt and there's even public transportation right near by but we didn't bother since we only needed cabs from and to the hotel. Parking, as is usual for Chicago, was expensive but we were able to get our car out quickly (however, we left on a Sunday morning, not exactly a high traffic time although it was a Bears homegame day, so a bit busier than usual I would think). No problems at all and the best part is that we got a rate of $100 through Hotwire, a downright steal for this area of Chicago and the quality of the hotel. \\n  \n",

While this address in Chicago requires a high level of quality, the Omni delivers. Check in for myself and a whole group of people with me was under 3 minutes, the staff had plentiful recommendations for dining and events, and the rooms are some of the largest you'll find at this price range in Chicago. Even the 'standard' room has a separate living area and work desk. The fitness center has free weights, weight machines, and two rows of cardio equipment. I shared the room with 7 others and did not feel cramped in any way! All in all, a great property! \\n  \n",

The room was pleasantly decorated, functional and very clean. I didn't need a whole lot of service but when I did they were pleasant and prompt. I used the fitness center which was well equipped and everything was in working order. It is in a great location at one end of the Michigan Avenue shopping district. \\n  \n",

Somehow I managed to get my reservation, and wish I had looked elsewhere on this great Chicago street, filled with plenty of other options. The server errors continued at check in and didn't let up. I was on a holiday weekend, but far too many others must have been pushy conventioneers, and I had trouble getting served. The hotel is enormous and doesn't give a sense of comfort. The health facilities are also just too big, so noisy and crowded. And Internet access was $18 a day, kind of surprising when I can go around the corner to a Starbucks! Next time, I'll pick a more intimate place nearby--without so many 'server errors'.\\n  \n",

When my wife and I got here, we were given keys to a room that had not even been cleaned! The Internet access promised on the hotel's website was down, so I couldn't catch up on any of the business I had intended to do, and my wife thought that the dark design details in the room made her feel claustrophobic, like she was sleeping inside a Salvador Dali painting. All in all, this hotel was not worth the money, especially since we spent most of our time enjoying the city--something more casual and comfortable would have been better, and it would probably have been cleaner, too!\\n  \n",

For the cost of the rooms starting at 179.00 a night, you would think they would have a competent parking attendant. I was delayed from a very important client due to a latency issue with my reserved room, and if that was not enough. To top it off the room service had the nerve to bring up room temperature pasta and a bottle of champagne that had the seal previously broken free of the cork. Needless to say this will be the last time this hotel ever is to grace so much as another dollar bill from my account. I would highly recommend another hotel with better accommodations.\\n  \n",

When I went through, the lobby was dirty, my room hadn't been cleaned, and smelled thoroughly of smoke. When I requested more pillows, the lady on the phone scoffed at me and said she'd send them up. It took over an hour for 2 pillows. This hotel is a good example that what you pay for isn't always what you get. I will not be returning.\\n  \n",
       "1599  As a former Chicagoan, I'm appalled at the Amalfi Hotel Chicago. First of all, I was expecting luxury and hospitality, neither of which I received. There's an Experience Designer who is supposed to be like a 'personal concierge,' but my experience with my ED was terrible. I felt like he was trying to pressure me into staying more days than I wanted to. Not only that, but I couldn't understand what he was saying most of the time because he was talking so fast. When I finally got to my room, I was disappointed with the quality of the furniture and the room's cleanliness. I had to ask for a maid to come and give me clean towels because some of the towels in the bathroom were damp. On top of that, the bed was messily done; I could have done a better job on my own bed at home. I was angry at this point, because I was paying a lot of money for every night I was staying at Amalfi, and I didn't expect to be greeted with wet towels. I needed to use the Wi-Fi to download some important documents, and the internet was surprisingly slow. Even a very basic hotel or motel could have offered better, maybe even faster internet access. When I finally checked out of the Amalfi, I made sure that my supposed personal concierge knew all of the problems I'd had with my room and the hotel. I was glad to see the Amalfi getting smaller in the mirror as I drove away!\\n  \n",

       "      <td>the amalfi hotel has a beautiful website and interior decorating  but that s about it  when my wife and i got here  we were given keys to a room that had not even been cleaned  the internet access promised on the hotel s website was down  so i couldn t catch up on any of the business i had intended to do  and my wife thought that the dark design details in the room made her feel claustrophobic  like she was sleeping inside a salvador dali painting  all in all  this hotel was not worth the money  especially since we spent most of our time enjoying the city  something more casual and comfortable would have been better  and it would probably have been cleaner  too</td>\n",

       "      <td>as a former chicagoan  i m appalled at the amalfi hotel chicago  first of all  i was expecting luxury and hospitality  neither of which i received  there s an experience designer who is supposed to be like a  personal concierge   but my experience with my ed was terrible  i felt like he was trying to pressure me into staying more days than i wanted to  not only that  but i couldn t understand what he was saying most of the time because he was talking so fast  when i finally got to my room  i was disappointed with the quality of the furniture and the room s cleanliness  i had to ask for a maid to come and give me clean towels because some of the towels in the bathroom were damp  on top of that  the bed was messily done  i could have done a better job on my own bed at home  i was angry at this point  because i was paying a lot of money for every night i was staying at amalfi  and i didn t expect to be greeted with wet towels  i needed to use the wi fi to download some important documents  and the internet was surprisingly slow  even a very basic hotel or motel could have offered better  maybe even faster internet access  when i finally checked out of the amalfi  i made sure that my supposed personal concierge knew all of the problems i d had with my room and the hotel  i was glad to see the amalfi getting smaller in the mirror as i drove away</td>\n",

       "1599  as a former chicagoan  i m appalled at the amalfi hotel chicago  first of all  i was expecting luxury and hospitality  neither of which i received  there s an experience designer who is supposed to be like a  personal concierge   but my experience with my ed was terrible  i felt like he was trying to pressure me into staying more days than i wanted to  not only that  but i couldn t understand what he was saying most of the time because he was talking so fast  when i finally got to my room  i was disappointed with the quality of the furniture and the room s cleanliness  i had to ask for a maid to come and give me clean towels because some of the towels in the bathroom were damp  on top of that  the bed was messily done  i could have done a better job on my own bed at home  i was angry at this point  because i was paying a lot of money for every night i was staying at amalfi  and i didn t expect to be greeted with wet towels  i needed to use the wi fi to download some important documents  and the internet was surprisingly slow  even a very basic hotel or motel could have offered better  maybe even faster internet access  when i finally checked out of the amalfi  i made sure that my supposed personal concierge knew all of the problems i d had with my room and the hotel  i was glad to see the amalfi getting smaller in the mirror as i drove away     \n",

Well, our stay here lasted 1 night and we quickly, and thankfully, switched to a different hotel for our last 4 nights. The room was dirty. When we opened the sofabed, the sheets were filthy and there was a mess of dirt and crumbs that fell out. Ridiculous considering this is a suite hotel where the sofabeds are likely used, and theoretically cleaned, a lot. Extra blankets were also dirty and bathrooms weren't much better. Temperature control in the room was imprecise - minor inconvenience but without clean blankets on our only night, it made for a cold stay. If you like to eat for free (they have free breakfasts and dinner on certain nights) and don't care to eat the great food Chicago has to offer, I guess some may find this place tolerable. But we found the buffet no better than average and felt like we were at a Golden Corral. The only thing this hotel really has going for it is location but there are other options in this area (we switched to The James and had a great experience). I couldn't be paid to stay here again. I'm shocked by the high overall rating given our experience.\"\n",

       "2    i choose the homewood suites in downtown chicago because i called them directly in search of a two bed room within walking distances of the attractions of chicago  well  when we arrived  it was apparent that there was chaos do to one of two elevators being out of service  which it had been since tuesday  this was saturday   once we finally got to the  floor to check in  i figured our relaxing time had begun  well  we got our room key and headed for  floor  again  waited for an elevator but finally made it two our room  i put the key in the door it opened to the surprise of me and the family already inside the room   yup we got double booked  the family was very nice and seemed ok with their surprise visitors  said our apologies and went back to the elevator and waited again to head back down to the  floor registration to figure the mess out  we have now been at the hotel for a half hour with no room and slightly annoyed  made it to the reservation desk and explained the situation  i did get an apology and a new room  new key in hand waited again for an elevator to bring us to the  floor for a new room  finally got to our room only to find it was a king suite  we are a family of four including two full grown teenage boys  there was no way they were going to fit on a pull out sofa  so  really annoyed now  i called the front desk and was told that were no rooms with two beds left even though i had specifically asked for two beds when i booked  it said two beds on preference on my reservation but the reservation agent assured me two beds would be available when i checked in  she went so far to but two beds on my reservation paper work  the operator said there are is only one two bed room on each floor  the only thing we got was a fold up bed that took away half the room in the living area  now  i paid a total of   for one night for this room  we got the mess mentioned above and a breakfast out of the deal  i am pretty sure my next trip to chicago will not include this hotel  i can tell you that we are frequent hws hilton customers but this hotel will not be on our list of stops in the future     \n",

    "new_text = \"We planned to stay for 5 nights on a family trip. I booked this hotel because of the expected value for a suite as well as the free breakfast - get a quick bite, then head out for the day to do normal tourist stuff. Well, our stay here lasted 1 night and we quickly, and thankfully, switched to a different hotel for our last 4 nights. The room was dirty. When we opened the sofabed, the sheets were filthy and there was a mess of dirt and crumbs that fell out. Ridiculous considering this is a suite hotel where the sofabeds are likely used, and theoretically cleaned, a lot. Extra blankets were also dirty and bathrooms weren't much better. Temperature control in the room was imprecise - minor inconvenience but without clean blankets on our only night, it made for a cold stay. If you like to eat for free (they have free breakfasts and dinner on certain nights) and don't care to eat the great food Chicago has to offer, I guess some may find this place tolerable. But we found the buffet no better than average and felt like we were at a Golden Corral. The only thing this hotel really has going for it is location but there are other options in this area (we switched to The James and had a great experience). I couldn't be paid to stay here again. I'm shocked by the high overall rating given our experience.\"\n",
